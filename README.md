# python-simulator

Small side project in Python for creating simulations where 2d objects ("entities") can interact with each other. 

The simulation consists in a sequence of frames (or video) where each frame is computed based on the logic of the existing entities. 

**This is obviously a work-in-progress project, don't even bother checking the code**
